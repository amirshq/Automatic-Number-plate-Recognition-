## Introduction
This project aims to develop an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that can identify and log vehicle license plates from multiple types of media. This can be useful in various domains such as security, traffic monitoring, and automation.

### Features
- Real-time plate recognition
- High accuracy and scalability
- Capable of handling multiple plate formats
- Robust against various lighting conditions and orientations

---

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV for image processing
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
- Plotly for visualization

---

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition.git
cd Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
To start the ANPR system, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --image /path/to/image
```

You can also use it with a webcam:

```bash
python main.py --webcam
```

For more options:

```bash
python main.py -h
```
